  <h1>OcuLife: Your eyes matter</h1>
  <h3>We use our eyes for hours a day on technology. We're gonna need those same eyes for the rest of our lives.</h3>

  <h2>What is OcuLife?</h2>
  <p>OcuLife is a screen protector. But it not only protects your screens with new biodegradable technology, it protects your eyes. Humans eyes are one <br>
  of the most important parts of our bodies, and imagining a life without vision is the stuff of horror. Using our screen protectors, you will be able to <br>
  protect your eyes in the most hassle-free and easy way possible.
  </p>
    </div>
  <div class="dividen2">
  <h2>How it works</h2>
  <p>When you apply the screen protector, it not only protects the screen with new technology that protects the screen like never before, but it also <br>
  protects your eyes using invisible layers of blue light filter biodegradable plastics. Research shows this technology will decrease the effects of <br>
  screens on your eyes by 30, depending on the person. That means, if you don't use our technology you can lose your eyesight by 60 years old, <br>
  but with it you can increase it by an extra 18 years!
